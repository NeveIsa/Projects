ÿxt2html/HTML::TextToHTML Sample Conversion

This sample is based hugely on the original sample.txt produced
by Seth Golub for txt2html.

I used the following options to convert this document:

     -titlefirst -mailmode -make_tables
     --custom_heading_regexp '^ *--[\w\s]+-- *$'
     --system_link_dict txt2html.dict
     --append_body sample.foot --infile sample.txt --outfile sample.html

This has either been done at the command line with:

	perl -MHTML::TextToHTML -e run_txt2html -- *options*

or using the script

	txt2html *options*

or from a (test) perl script with:
	
	use HTML::TextToHTML;
	my $conv = new HTML::TextToHTML();
	$conv->txt2html([*options*]);

Good idea.  I'll write something up.

The header lines were kept separate because they looked like mail
headers and I have mailmode on.  The same thing applies to Bozo's
quoted text.  Mailmode doesn't screw things up very often, but since
most people are usually converting non-mail, it's off by default.

Paragraphs are handled ok.  In fact, this one is here just to
demonstrate that.

THIS LINE IS VERY IMPORTANT!
(Ok, it wasn't *that* important)


EXAMPLE HEADER
==============

Since this is the first header noticed (all caps, underlined with an
"="), it will be a level 1 header.  It gets an anchor named
"section_1".

Another example
===============
This is the second type of header (not all caps, underlined with "=").
It gets an ancho
