so that the computer would not screech alarms and its screen
flash bright red whenever he keyed in at its screen prompt
the declaration "Gus Farwick is a testosterone-less simp
with eel toes for brains!"  But, as much as the assembly
language savant would have liked to become involved in such
a worthwhile project, he was too preoccupied at the moment
with his many neurotic frets, especially his fear of the
possible return of the ghost of Alan Turing to his former
domicile in Austin's office coat closet, to be able to do
anything but gape zombie-like into the flourescent-white
night air and drool down the front of his checked shirt
until eventually the computer builder shuffled away.

     Still gaping, Austin could hear him pawing through the
section of the thesaurus that listed synonyms for
"testosterone-less simp."  "Ninnyhead.  Puddingbrain.
Knucklenoggin," he recited in his nasal drone.  He
laboriously typed them one by one into the guided missile
software, then groaned as the screen flashed red in response
and the alarm bells chimed.  "This is what I get for having
familiarized that twit programmer with my entire range of
verbal invective," he grunted, flinging open another
thesaurus.  He raised his head and mused, "Maybe if I tried
some alternate spellings...."  After some thought, he typed
into the machine "Gees...Farwoook...is...a...
Tusktossturoon-Mess Imp...Wif...Eeeel-Tooeys...4...Brains!"
The computer responded with a long, slow gag, then flashed
its screen red and chimed like a maimed pinball machine.
The computer builder slammed his fist on the desk in rage.

     Tired, the assembly language savant nestled his head on
the worn ivories of his keyboard and listened to his
officemate's wild, futile linguistic manipulations until
late in the night.  Eventually he fell asleep.  In his
troubled dreams, he thought he saw the flyblown profile of
the ghost who dogged him, who terrified him day and night
with his incessant ravings about long-forgotten computer
memory registers, the irrepressible ghost of Alan Turing,
the father of programming.  Turing materialized, tweed suit,
shabby wingtips, cobwebbed copy of <<Byte>>, battered
bicycle and all, in back of the computer builder's zebra-fur
cloaked chair.  With a devil-may-care glower that was not
unlike the computer builder's own condescending smirk, he
extended shadowy hands over the latter's shoulder.  He took
hold of the computer builder's Hanswurst knuckles, and, with
the impassioned vigor of a symphonic conductor, guided them
into a manic dance across the terminal's keys.
