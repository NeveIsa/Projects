
The Wolf and the Lamb 
  by Aesop
 
WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to
lay violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the
Lamb the Wolf's right to eat him.  He thus addressed him:
"Sirrah, last year you grossly insulted me."  "Indeed," bleated
the Lamb in a mournful tone of voice, "I was not then born."  Then
said the Wolf, "You feed in my pasture."  "No, good sir," replied
the Lamb, "I have not yet tasted grass."  Again said the Wolf,
"You drink of my well."  "No," exclaimed the Lamb, "I never yet
drank water, for as yet my mother's milk is both food and drink
to me."  Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying,
"Well! I won't remain supperless, even though you refute every
one of my imputations."  

The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.   
------------------------------------------------------

  And, with an updated twist:




THE OLD LADY AND THE CRYPT or BLOOD
  by someone who read Aesop

GANGMEMBER, meeting an Old Lady astray from the crowd, resolved not 
to waste the old bitch, but wanted to listen to pleas of mercy and 
desperation from the Old Lady of Gangmember's right to prey on her. 
He vexed the old broad, "You get your money and food stamps from the
government. I get none!" "PLEASE," bleated the Old Lady, "I was born a
long time ago and made no rules." The Gangmember retorted, "Old and 
time for you to die." "BUT," exclaimed the Old Lady, "If you take my
life, I can no longer be robbed once a month." The Gangmember threatened,
"You don't have the right to be on my turf." Old Lady pleaded, "I got
lost on the subway and didn't mean to be here. Why, I could even be 
your Mother!"  Upon which the Gangmember shot her and robbed her of all 
she had, saying, "Old Lady you ain't shit to me! even if you were my
mother. I need the green."

The gangmember has needs too, ya know, even if, needlessly meaningless.

e assembly language savant nestled his head on
the worn ivories of his keyboard and listened to his
officemate's wild, futile linguistic manipulations until
late in the night.  Eventually he fell asleep.  In his
troubled dreams, he thought he saw the flyblown profile of
the ghost who dogged him, who terrified him day and night
with his incessant ravings about long-forgotten computer
memory registers, the irrepressible ghost of Alan Turing,
the father of programming.  Turing materialized, tweed suit,
shabby wingtips, cobwebbed copy of <<Byte>>, battered
bicycle and all, in back of the computer builder's zebra-fur
cloaked chair.  With a devil-may-care glower that was not
unlike the computer builder's own condescending smirk, he
extended shadowy hands over the latter's shoulder.  He took
hold of the computer builder's Hanswurst knuckles, and, with
the impassioned vigor of a symphonic conductor, guided them
into a manic dance across the terminal's keys.

     The computer builder, unaware of the ghost's presence,
watched his gamboling hands, aghast.  When his finger were
finally still, lying in an artistically spent, twisted heap,
like the hands of Beethoven on the numeric keypad, he looked
at them in surpise, then glanced up at the screen.
"Omigod!" he gasped.  "I have done it!  My genius has won
out again!  I have found a way to disable Andrew.BAS's kooky
language parser!"  He smiled with pride at the string of
inscrutable algorithms marching across the screen.  "Gawd,
how I wish I could understand what those are," he clucked,
typing into the missile software "testosterone-less simp,"
adding "with eel toes for brains."  He pressed 'enter' and
listened closely, but heard no warning bells, nor did he see
the screen flash red.  He smiled, "Gus Farwick, prepare to
read your epitaph in the sky."  The ghost nodded with
approval, got on his bike, and disappeared, and the computer
builder leaped from his chair and hopped from foot to foot
like a wound up harlequin.

ic routines are not checked for BUGS. In
those places where errors are widespread you should not, if you can possibly
avoid it, use routines from a contract programmer.

In certain start-up companies, routines may not be properly debugged. If you
can, avoid using interrupt repairs or patches. If you are in any doubt about
these points then discuss them with your course leader.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.   Do You Need More Information?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The true picture about BUGS is that, at the moment, relatively few programs
are infected with proper full-blown BUGS. Those most at risk are assembler
programs which have common code with other assembler programs, programs
which share software interrupts, and users of these programs.

But BUGS is spreading. And as it does, so the risk of sharing an infected
routine also increases.

Ultimately, defence against BUGS depends on us all taking responsibility for
our own logical and programming actions.

ic routines are not checked for BUGS. In
those places where errors are widespread you should not, if you can possibly
avoid it, use routines from a contract programmer.

In certain start-up companies, routines may not be properly debugged. If you
can, avoid using interrupt repairs or patches. If you are in any doubt about
these points then discuss them with your course leader.

10.   Do You Need More Information?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The true picture about BUGS is that, at the moment, relatively few programs
are infected with proper full-blown BUGS. Those most at risk are assembler
programs which have common code with other assembler programs, programs
which share software interrupts, and users of these programs.

But BUGS is spreading. And as it does, so the risk of sharing an infected
routine also increases.

Ultimately, defence against BUGS depends on us all taking responsibility for
our own logical and programming actions.

The Wolf and the Lamb 
  by Aesop
 
WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to
lay violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the
Lamb the Wolf's right to eat him.  He thus addressed him:
"Sirrah, last year you grossly insulted me."  "Indeed," bleated
the Lamb in a mournful tone of voice, "I was not then born."  Then
said the Wolf, "You feed in my pasture."  "No, good sir," replied
the Lamb, "I have not yet tasted grass."  Again said the Wolf,
"You drink of my well."  "No," exclaimed the Lamb, "I never yet
drank water, for as yet my mother's milk is both food and drink
to me."  Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying,
"Well! I won't remain supperless, even though you refute every
one of my imputations."  

The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.

THE OLD LADY AND THE CRYPT or BLOOD
  by someone who read Aesop

GANGMEMBER, meeting an Old Lady astray from the crowd, resolved not 
to waste the old bitch, but wanted to listen to pleas of mercy and 
desperation from the Old Lady of Gangmember's right to prey on her. 
He vexed the old broad, "You get your money and food stamps from the
government. I get none!" "PLEASE," bleated the Old Lady, "I was born a
long time ago and made no rules." The Gangmember retorted, "Old and 
time for you to die." "BUT," exclaimed the Old Lady, "If you take my
life, I can no longer be robbed once a month." The Gangmember threatened,
"You don't have the right to be on my turf." Old Lady pleaded, "I got
lost on the subway and didn't mean to be here. Why, I could even be 
your Mother!"  Upon which the Gangmember shot her and robbed her of all 
she had, saying, "Old Lady you ain't shit to me! even if you were my
mother. I need the green."

The gangmember has needs too, ya know, even if, needlessly meaningless.

troubled dreams, he thought he saw the flyblown profile of

memory registers, the irrepressible ghost of Alan Turing,
the father of programming.  Turing materialized, tweed suit,

cloaked chair.  With a devil-may-care glower that was not
unlike the computer builder's own condescending smirk, he
extended shadowy hands over the latter's shoulder.  He took
hold of the computer builder's Hanswurst knuckles, and, with
the impassioned vigor of a symphonic conductor, guided them
into a manic dance across the terminal's keys.

     The computer builder, unaware of the ghost's presence,

like the hands of Beethoven on the numeric keypad, he looked

The Wolf and the Lamb 
  by Aesop
 
WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to
lay violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the
Lamb the Wolf's right to eat him.  He thus addressed him:
"Sirrah, last year you grossly insulted me."  "Indeed," bleated
the Lamb in a mournful tone of voice, "I was not then born."  Then
said the Wolf, "You feed in my pasture."  "No, good sir," replied
the Lamb, "I have not yet tasted grass."  Again said the Wolf,
"You drink of my well."  "No," exclaimed the Lamb, "I never yet
drank water, for as yet my mother's milk is both food and drink
to me."  Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying,
"Well! I won't remain supperless, even though you refute every
one of my imputations."  

The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.

  And, with an updated twist:




THE OLD LADY AND THE CRYPT or BLOOD
  by someone who read Aesop

GANGMEMBER, meeting an Old Lady astray from the crowd, resolved not 
to waste the old bitch, but wanted to listen to pleas of mercy and 
desperation from the Old Lady of Gangmember's right to prey on her. 
He vexed the old broad, "You get your money and food stamps from the
government. I get none!" "PLEASE," bleated the Old Lady, "I was born a
long time ago and made no rules." The Gangmember retorted, "Old and 
time for you to die." "BUT," exclaimed the Old Lady, "If you take my
life, I can no longer be robbed once a month." The Gangmember threatened,
"You don't have the right to be on my turf." Old Lady pleaded, "I got
lost on the subway and didn't mean to be here. Why, I could even be 
your Mother!"  Upon which the Gangmember shot her and robbed her of all 
she had, saying, "Old Lady you ain't shit to me! even if you were my
mother. I need the green."

The gangmember has needs too, ya know, even if, needlessly meaningless.

e assembly language savant nestled his head on
the worn ivories of his keyboard and listened to his
officemate's wild, futile linguistic manipulations until
late in the night.  Eventually he fell asleep.  In his
troubled dreams, he thought he saw the flyblown profile of
the ghost who dogged him, who terrified him day and night
with his incessant ravings about long-forgotten computer
memory registers, the irrepressible ghost of Alan Turing,
the father of programming.  Turing materialized, tweed suit,
shabby wingtips, cobwebbed copy of <<Byte>>, battered
bicycle and all, in back of the computer builder's zebra-fur
cloaked chair.  With a devil-may-care glower that was not
unlike the computer builder's own condescending smirk, he
extended shadowy hands over the latter's shoulder.  He took
hold of the computer builder's Hanswurst knuckles, and, with
the impassioned vigor of a symphonic conductor, guided them
into a manic dance across the terminal's keys.

     The computer builder, unaware of the ghost's presence,
watched his gamboling hands, aghast.  When his finger were
finally still, lying in an artistically spent, twisted heap,
like the hands of Beethoven on the numeric keypad, he looked
at them in surpise, then glanced up at the screen.
"Omigod!" he gasped.  "I have done it!  My genius has won
out again!  I have found a way to disable Andrew.BAS's kooky
language parser!"  He smiled with pride at the string of
inscrutable algorithms marching across the screen.  "Gawd,
how I wish I could understand what those are," he clucked,
typing into the missile software "testosterone-less simp,"
adding "with eel toes for brains."  He pressed 'enter' and
listened closely, but heard no warning bells, nor did he see
the screen flash red.  He smiled, "Gus Farwick, prepare to
read your epitaph in the sky."  The ghost nodded with
approval, got on his bike, and disappeared, and the computer
builder leaped from his chair and hopped from foot to foot
like a wound up harlequin.

here, and my routines
For integer conversion, I wene,
Should enjoy their approval.

But, (he said with dismal voice)
Hackers may no longer have a choice
About using compilers. Assembled code will run,
but writing it will not be fun, and it will lack finesse.
Compiler writers, on the other hand,
Will be very much in demand,
To make the humblest code run faster.
Indeed, it will be a master
Who can write compilers for my interface -
if single instructions are hard to trace,
Try two, or five, or ten at once.

For speed, my modest design fronts
Multiple instructions, you see,
Since much of my design is free
To work when other parts are taken.
Scalability is what brings home the bacon."

HIs tale all done, smitten were we,
With such insightful technology,
Like a fine Bordeaux, he could
Be drunken today, but would
Be better in a few years time.

This young Alpha, first in line
Of a family of amazing power,
Fearsome indeed, we could but lower
Our eyes, for no barbing jest
Or tale that could best
The Alpha's story came into our minds.

"Worry not", said he, "That was but the Marketer's line,
And money talks; just wait and see
If the Architect's delivery
Lives up to the marketing hype."

The Alpha was correct; his life
Depended on inventions which,
Although likely, still had yet to be.
Yet though he made that warning,
Tomorrow brought a morning,
One bit closer to the day,
When our users would be forced to say
That we'd run out of steam.

Humbled were we by Alpha's dream,
With shaky steps we continued on,
Our journey seeming ever long,
Unto our fate: Anon.

ic routines are not checked for BUGS. In
those places where errors are widespread you should not, if you can possibly
avoid it, use routines from a contract programmer.

In certain start-up companies, routines may not be properly debugged. If you
can, avoid using interrupt repairs or patches. If you are in any doubt about
these points then discuss them with your course leader.

10.   Do You Need More Information?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The true picture about BUGS is that, at the moment, relatively few programs
are infected with proper full-blown BUGS. Those most at risk are assembler
programs which have common code with other assembler programs, programs
which share software interrupts, and users of these programs.

But BUGS is spreading. And as it does, so the risk of sharing an infected
routine also increases.

Ultimately, defence against BUGS depends on us all taking responsibility for
our own logical and programming actions.
